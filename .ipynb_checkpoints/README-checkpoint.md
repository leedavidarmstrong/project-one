## Project description
Using a dataset with information related to Uber trips, we aim to analyse the relationship between Uber usage and the weather.
## Research question to answer
•	Is the weather a variable that influences Uber usage?  
•	Is the price of an Uber trip dependent on the weather?
    Amount of passengers vs weather conditions
    Amount of passengers vs distance travelled
    Weather conditions vs distance travelled
    times of year season etc vs regularity of uber usage?
    usage of uber service for rural or city?
    fair/cost vs pick up times - peak hours/days of week and/or public holidays etc.
## Datasets to be used
•	uber.csv  
•	uber_df_ascending.csv (csv changed or generated depending on data requirements)   
    openweather.api
## Rough breakdown of tasks
•	Clone repository to desktops   
•	Upload original datasets and update readme file with project description   
•	Merge and clean data   (Note: maintain csv file and clean change data with ne dataframes within the code to avoid multiple csv files.)
•	Analyse tendencies and relationship between Uber trips and weather   
•	Analyse tendencies and relationship between Uber trip prices and weather 
    geolocate pick up/drop off locations. Area type(rural/city etc)
    Relationship between amount of passengers vs weather conditions
•	Generate conclusions
